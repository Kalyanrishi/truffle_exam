1) Explain briefly the steps involved in initiating a project in Truffle
and demonstrate the same?

Ans)The first step to initiate a project in Truffle are
  Step 01: Creating a new directory for Truffle Project
     mkdir MetaCoin (make directory of MetaCoin)
     cd MetaCion (Current Working Directory MetaCoin)
 Step 02: Download "unbox" the MetaCoin box using command as
                      "truffle unbox metacoin"
Step 03: After unboxing use the command in terminal as 
                     "truffle init"
Step 04: Once the operation of downloading the truffle project metacoin is completed, we will see the
            project structure as

        ->MetaCion /
           ->contracts/--> directory for solidity contracts
           ->migrations/--> directory for scriptable deployment files.
           ->test/--> these are test files for testing
           ->truffle.js/--> truffle configuration file.
