2) How to Write and Compile a Solidity Smart Contract file using
Truffle?
Ans)The first step to write solidity smart contract is to open the folder which we have created as MetaCoin it structure as follows:-

->MetaCion /
           ->contracts/--> directory for solidity contracts
           ->migrations/--> directory for scriptable deployment files.
           ->test/--> these are test files for testing
           ->truffle.js/--> truffle configuration file.
* Second step is to open the contracts folder and write the Solidity smart contacts
* for compiling the smart contact there are different ways such as
   for compiling we command in terminal as "truffle compile"
   for migrating we use "truffle migrate"
